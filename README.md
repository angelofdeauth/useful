## ssh-keygen-alias

My go-to defaults for ssh-keygen.

## kill-signals

The -l option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their  corresponding  numbers.   Each  sigspec  is  either  a  signal name defined in <signal.h>, or a signal  number.   Signal  names  are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional.
